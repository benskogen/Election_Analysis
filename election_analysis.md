\
## Purpose\
	To assist the Colorado Board of Employees with an election audit of a recent congressional election audit, by drawing 	results upon raw data and making inferences upon them.  Inferences were made upon collected data including, but not 	limited to: total number of voters (also categorized as voters & votes per county), and the total number of votes per 	candidate.\
\
## Resources\
	Data Source: election_results.csv\
	Software:  Python 3.10.2, Visual Code Studio 1.66.0\

\ls1\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}I could not figure out linking the file path to the .csv file to my VSC .py terminal window.  Followed the directions and \'93plan B\'94 instructions, but I simply could not get it to work, even though the .csv file and was in the same file folder as my .py file.  I could not figure out why I was unable to declare my csvpath to the election results .csv file.  I filled out the code the best I could, from what I learned in the Module 3 coursework, and from what I was able to pull together from Slack and from the office hour recordings.  I was able to find that Denver had by far the most votes, and that Diana DeGette of Denver had way more votes than any other candidate, but the only results I can show for that is by a simple pivot table I made in Excel from the .csv data provided.\

	Please note:  I will be resubmitting this assignment once I am able to sort out the few issues I was facing, as I wasn\'92t able to debug 	the code without seeing the output.\
